# 🧠 Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Platform

A robust, production-ready Generative AI system for **generating realistic images from text prompts using diffusion models**. This platform enables end-to-end automation—covering dataset preparation, fully distributed training, validation, experiment tracking, and scalable deployment for inference. The architecture prioritizes modularity, reproducibility, and extensible engineering, targeting real-world research and production needs in generative AI.

Below the surface, the pipeline integrates Amazon SageMaker for scalable distributed training across GPU clusters, MLflow for comprehensive experiment and artifacts tracking, Airflow for orchestration of the entire ML lifecycle, ONNX export for high-performance inference (including TorchServe compatibility), and S3-based data and model management. All processes are fully containerized, with Python best practices (including FastAPI/Pydantic validation and tightly managed dependencies) ensuring maintainability and cloud portability.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modeling:** Custom diffusion pipeline powered by a UNet2DConditionModel, AutoencoderKL, and CLIP text encoder for text conditioning.
- **Task:** State-of-the-art **text-to-image generation** using scalable transformer and diffusion architectures.
- **Data:** Easily configured for any image-text dataset; pipeline example uses a flower image-caption dataset.
- **Distributed Training:** DeepSpeed or DDP distributed training on AWS SageMaker, supporting cloud and containerized runs.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Centralized with MLflow, including auto-logging of hyperparameters, metrics, and best model checkpoints.
- **Deployment:** Models are exported to ONNX for efficient inference, with TorchServe integration for seamless API deployment.
- **Automation & Orchestration:** Apache Airflow DAGs encapsulate data upload, training jobs, model management, and deployment tasks.
- **Versioning & Reproducibility:** All configuration and code version controlled via YAML and MLflow; Docker images ensure full environment reproducibility.

## 🧩 Highlights

- **Trained on the Cloud:** Leverages AWS SageMaker for cost-efficient, elastic training across numerous GPUs.
- **ONNX & TorchServe Integration:** Fast, portable inference via ONNX conversion and TorchServe endpoints.
- **Airflow Orchestration:** Robust MLOps “as code” with Airflow for orchestrating dataset uploads, launching training, artifact downloading, and ONNX packaging.
- **MLflow Experiment Management:** Every run, model, and metric tracked for transparency and easy model selection.
- **Flexible Configs:** All pipeline parameters, hyperparameters, and AWS/SageMaker details managed by Pydantic-backed YAML configs.
- **Production MLOps:** Hidden engineering details—dependency pinning, secure credentials management, and auto-scaling ready infrastructure.

## 🔧 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/ml-diffusion-platform && cd ml-diffusion-platform
docker-compose build --parallel
docker-compose up -d              # launches Airflow and dependencies
# Update configs (config/pipeline_config.yaml), place your image-text data
# Use Airflow UI or CLI to trigger the ML pipeline (data→train→register→deploy)
```
